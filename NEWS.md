# version 0.0.1.9001

First usable version with the method based on the 'importance weight' of
internal knots based on reversing the methods presented by Boehm (1980).

## Vignettes

* The beginnings of the control-polygon vignette started (version 0.0.1.9001)

# version 0.0.1
This version was based on the idea that using an angle to reduce the control
polygon was a good idea.  Further literature review and simulations showed
otherwise.  This version is marked for posterity and the cpp functions are going
to be useful in the following versions as well.
