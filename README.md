An R package for implementing the Control Polygon Reduction model
selection method.  When we are tasked with modeling the functional relationship
between a response and a continuous predictor, i.e., y = f(x), CPR allows for quick and
efficient searching of a large model space to find B-spline estimates of the
function f(x).

CPR extends to multiple dimensions and allows one to find good locations for
knots in a tensor product of B-splines.

This model selection method was developed as part of [Peter DeWitt's PhD
dissertation](https://doi.org/10.25677/awnc-b795) work.  It has been extended
since.

* The CPR method was presented at the 28th International Biometric Conference
  held July 2016, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  The abstract, paper,
  and talk had the title:
  "Parsimonious B-splines Regression Models via Control Polygon
  Reduction."  A bibtex entry for the abstract:

**Awards:** The presentation of the work earned Peter DeWitt two awards:

1. "Best Student Oral Presentation" from the International Biometric Society
   (IBS).
2. "Distinguished Oral Presentation" as part of the student
   paper competition hosted by the Western North American Region
   (WNAR) of the IBS.

## Installing CPR

### Released Version

Install from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)

```r
# within R
install.packages("cpr", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.com")
```

### Developmental Version

If you are working on a Windows machine you will need to have
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) installed.

#### From github

This will require you to have
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes) package installed.

```r
# Just the package without the manual and without vignettes
remotes::install_github(repo = "dewittpe/cpr")

# Install with vignettes
remotes::install_github(
    repo = "dewittpe/cpr"
  , dependbuild_vignettes = TRUE
  , dependencies = TRUE
)
```

#### From a cloned repository

You'll need to have the R package
[devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools) installed on your
machine.

To check R dependencies before building, or after you get errors due to missing
R packages run:
```r
devtools::install_dev_deps()
```

To build the R package and install the dev version on you machine:

```bash
make install
```

Alternatively, you should be able to build and install without `make`
```bash
R CMD build <path to cloned repo>
R CMD INSTALL cpr_<version>.tar.gz
```

## Other Notes:
The `cpr` package provides 3D graphics via the
[`rgl`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) package.  If you are get an
error, or rather message, of the form:
```
  font family "sans" not found, using "bitmap"
```
Then there is an easy fix.  You need to get the [FreeType 2 font
engine](https://freetype.org/).

On Debian, you can get the library via:

```bash
apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
```

Once the FreeType 2 font engine has been installed on your computer you **must
reinstall** the `rgl` package.
