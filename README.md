An R package for implementing the Control Polygon Reduction model
selection method.  When we are tasked with modeling the functional relationship
between a response and a continuous predictor, i.e., y = f(x), CPR allows for quick and
efficient searching of a large model space to find B-spline estiamtes of the
function f(x).  

CPR extends to multiple dimensions and allows one to find good locations for
knots in a tensor product of B-splines.

## Learn More About CPR.
This model selection method was developed as part of Peter DeWitt's PhD
dissertation work.
