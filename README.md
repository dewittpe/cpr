# CPR: Control Polygon Reduction

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dewittpe/cpr.svg?token=jowN3QrQKY7UdmTc4Efp&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dewittpe/cpr)

An R package for implementing the Control Polygon Reduction model
selection method.  When we are tasked with modeling the functional relationship
between a response and a continuous predictor, i.e., y = f(x), CPR allows for quick and
efficient searching of a large model space to find B-spline estiamtes of the
function f(x).  

CPR extends to multiple dimensions and allows one to find good locations for
knots in a tensor product of B-splines.

## Learn More About CPR.
This model selection method was developed as part of Peter DeWitt's PhD
dissertation work.

## Installing CPR
Currently CPR is under private development.  

Options for installing CPR:

1. Clone the repo and use `GNU make`

    make install

2. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/dewittpe/cpr/releases) and down
   load the tar.gz file of the version you want to install.

  * Install from the command line

```bash
R CMD INSTALL cpr_<version>.tar.gz
```

  * Within R

```r
install.packages(<path_to_file>, repos = NULL, type="source")
```

## Other Notes:
The `cpr` package provides 3D graphics via the
[`rgl`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgl) package.  If you are get an
error, or rather message, of the form:
```
  font family "sans" not found, using "bitmap"
```
Then there is an easy fix.  You need to get the [FreeType 2 font
engine](https://www.freetype.org/).  

On Debian, you can get the library via:

```
apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
```

Once the FreeType 2 font engine has been installed on your computer you **must
reinstall** the `rgl` package.
