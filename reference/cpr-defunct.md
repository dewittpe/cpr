# Defunct Functions

A major refactor of the package between v0.3.0 and v.0.4.0 took place
and many functions were made defunct. The refactor was so extensive that
moving the functions to deprecated was not a viable option.

## Usage

``` r
refine_ordinate(...)

coarsen_ordinate(...)

hat_ordinate(...)

insertion_matrix(...)

wiegh_iknots(...)

influence_of(...)

influence_weights(...)
```

## Arguments

- ...:

  pass through
