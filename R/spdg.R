#' Simulated Prognanediol-glucuronid (PDG) Data
#'
#' A Simulated data set based on the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
#' (SWAN) Daily Hormone Study (DHS).
#'
#' Prognanediol-glucuronid (PDG) is the urine metabolite of progesterone.  This
#' data set was simulated to have similar
#' characteristics to a subset of the SWAN DHS data.  The SWAN DHS data was the
#' motivating data set for the method development that lead to the \code{cpr}
#' package.  The DHS data cannot be made public, so this simulated data set has
#' been provided for use in examples and instructions for use of the \code{cpr}
#' package.
