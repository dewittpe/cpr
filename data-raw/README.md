# CPR Package data-raw
There are two files in this directory: `dhs_summary.rds` and `spdg.R`.  The
first file, `dhs_summary.rds` is a list object with summary statistics and
densities based on a subset of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
(SWAN) Daily Hormone Study (DHS) data set.   The `spdg.R` file creates the data
set `spdg` which is provided in the `cpr` package to illustrate the basic use of
the package.
